  <p align="center">
    BioFi aims to incentivize and help the user reduce the time spent on screens while being able to prove it.
    With a playful aspect ( quests / tokenomics / nfts) and real utilities (certified proof of time reduction with Verifiable Credentials) we believe this project can be a game changer.
